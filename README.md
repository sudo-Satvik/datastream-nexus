# DataStream Nexus

## Description
**DataStream Nexus** is a powerful Node.js application that aggregates real-time data from various external APIs. Utilizing Express.js and MongoDB, it offers efficient data retrieval and storage, robust error handling, and a scalable architecture. Ideal for applications requiring live insights, this project focuses on reliability and performance.

## Features
- **Real-Time Data Aggregation**: Seamlessly integrates with multiple APIs to fetch live updates.
- **Efficient API Request Handling**: Utilizes asynchronous programming for non-blocking operations.
- **MongoDB Storage**: Stores aggregated data for quick retrieval and analysis.
- **Robust Error Handling**: Implements comprehensive error tracking and logging to ensure reliability.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: (Optional) An interactive dashboard for visualizing the data (link to frontend project).

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime for building server-side applications.
- **Express.js**: Web framework for building APIs and managing routes.
- **MongoDB**: NoSQL database for storing aggregated data.
- **Axios**: Promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
- **Mongoose**: ODM library for MongoDB and Node.js.
